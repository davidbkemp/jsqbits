Javascript library for quantum computation simulation.

jsqbits is not quite ready for release.
Some user documentation will need to be written for starters.

But you can still try it out now in your browser now using
the jsqbits runner http://davidbkemp.github.com/jsqbits/jsqbitsRunner.html

TODO before first release:
* Documentation
* Tofolli gate
* Allow control bits for all operations to be multiple bits.
* Implement Simon's algorithm
