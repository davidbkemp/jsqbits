JavaScript library for quantum computation simulation.

jsqbits is not quite ready for release.
Some user documentation will need to be written for starters.

The user manual is only half finished, but what there is of it can be found here:
http://davidbkemp.github.com/jsqbits/doc/jsqbitsManual.html

But you can still try it out now in your browser using
the jsqbits runner http://davidbkemp.github.com/jsqbits/jsqbitsRunner.html

TODO before first release:
* Documentation
* Consider jsqubits instead of jsqbits
* Hide attributes of Complex and QState

Nice to have:
* Allow array of bits anywhere we currently allow a bit range (measure() and applyFunction())
* Implementation of Simon's algorithm
* Include a 'remainingQbits' field on measurement outcomes.
* JSLint?
* Coverage?

Future releases:
* Quantum Fourier Transform
* Shor's Algorithm
* Grover's Algorithm
* Mermin-Peres magic square
