JavaScript library for quantum computation simulation.

jsqbits is not quite ready for release.

Try it out online using the jsqbits runner:

TODO before first release:
* Use hasOwnProperty where needed.
* Fix sorting in sortedNonZeroStates() method.
* Consider making amplitudes an object instead of an array.
* Hide attributes of Complex and QState

Nice to have:
* Fix exceptions to follow a more standard pattern
* Allow array of bits anywhere we currently allow a bit range (measure() and applyFunction())
* Implementation of Simon's algorithm
* Include a 'remainingQbits' field on measurement outcomes.
* JSLint?
* Coverage?

Future releases:
* Quantum Fourier Transform
* Shor's Algorithm
* Grover's Algorithm
* Mermin-Peres magic square
