Javascript library for quantum computation simulation.

jsqbits is not quite ready for release.
Some user documentation will need to be written for starters.

But you can still try it out now in your browser now using
the jsqbits runner http://davidbkemp.github.com/jsqbits/jsqbitsRunner.html

TODO before first release:
* Documentation
* Implement Simon's algorithm
* Argument validation (including checks that control and target bits do not overlap)
* Check 0 is not being treated as null
* JSLint?

Nice to have:
* Allow target bit spec to be an array.
* Allow array of bits anywhere we currently allow a bit range.
