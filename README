Javascript library for quantum computation simulation.

jsqbits is not quite ready for release.
Some user documentation will need to be written for starters.

But you can still try it out now in your browser using
the jsqbits runner http://davidbkemp.github.com/jsqbits/jsqbitsRunner.html

TODO before first release:
* Documentation

Nice to have:
* Allow array of bits anywhere we currently allow a bit range (measure() and applyFunction())
* Implementation of Simon's algorithm
* Include a 'remainingQbits' field on measurement outcomes.
* Include a 'toString' method on measurement outcomes.
* JSLint?
* Coverage?
