<h1>An Introduction to Quantum Programming using jsqbits</h1>
<p>
    Quantum computers make use of quantum interference and superposition for some of their computation
    (at least the quantum computers with which we are concerned do).
    The purpose of this tutorial is to introduce you to the basic concepts of quantum programming
    using examples that you can try out on
    the online <a href="http://davidbkemp.github.com/jsqbits/jsqbitsRunner.html">jsqbits runner</a>.
</p>

<h2>Qubits</h2>
<!-- Dirac notation, Hadamard, Not, and cnot. -->
<p>
    Like conventional computers, quantum computers typically use a binary encoding of information.
    However, instead of "bits", quantum computers use "quantum bits" (abbreviated to "qubits" or "qbits").
    These are like bits in that they have two states (typically represented as "0" or "1"),
    but they have the extra properties of being capable of being
    in a "superposition" of states and being "entangled" with each other
    (terms that will be explained later).
    Note real implementations of qubits do exist using, for example, nuclear spin.
</p>

<h3>Dirac Notation</h3>
<p>
    We use the "Dirac" or "bra-ket" notation commonly used in quantum mechanics.
    The advantages of this notation will not be immediately apparent,
    but it helps if we use the notation used in most of the quantum programming literature.
    Under the Dirac notation, the state of a quantum computer is prefixed by a vertical bar "|"
    and ends with a greater-than symbol ">".
    For example, a four qubit quantum computer with all its qubits are in a zero state
    is represented as <code>|0000></code>.
</p>

<h3>Superposition and Measurement</h3>
<p>
    There are several special quantum operators. One of these is called the Hadamard operator.
    At first glance, the Hadamard operator seems to put a qubit into a random state.
    For instance, if we were to apply the Hadamard operator to the right most bit (bit 0) of <code>|0000></code>
    and then print out the state of the qubits,
    then half the time it would be <code>|0000></code>
    and the other half it would be <code>|0001></code>.
    But there is much much more to it than that.
</p>

<p>
    If you apply the Hadamard operator twice to a qubit (without doing anything in between),
    then the qubit will return to its original state.
    Other operators are so bizarre
    that they are best modelled as rotations of a sphere (more on that later).
</p>

<p>
    When we said that printing out the state of a computer's qubits
    randomly lead to one of two possible outcomes,
    it turns out that it is best to think of the system being in <em>both states at once</em>.
    This is more formally called a <em>superposition</em> of the two states.
    Each of the different possible outcomes will have a different associated probability.
    This is modelled by associating an "amplitude" with each possibility,
    where the amplitude is a number whose magnitude needs to be squared to
    get the actual probability.
</p>

<p>
    After applying the Hadamard operator to a qubit that is originally in a zero state (<code>|0></code>),
    it ends up in a super position of <code>|0></code> and <code>|1></code>,
    each with an associated amplitude of the square root of one half
    (remember, you need to square the amplitude to get the probability).
    The Dirac notation for the resulting state is:
</p>
<code>&#x221a;(1/2)|0> + &#x221a;(1/2)|1></code>
<p>
    Note that the '+' symbol here does not really mean that we are adding the two states together.
    Adding <code>|0></code> to <code>|1></code> does not give you anything besides
    <code>|0></code> and <code>|1></code>.
    It is just a convenient notation for representing superpositions
    whose benefits will become apparent in a moment.
</p>

<p>
    After applying the Hadamard operator to a qubit that is originally is <code>|1></code>,
    the resulting state is:
</p>
<code>&#x221a;(1/2)|0> - &#x221a;(1/2)|1></code>
<p><em>Notice the minus sign</em>.</p>
<p>
    The significance of the minus sign becomes apparent when you apply the Hadamard operation twice.
    Suppose we start with <code>|0></code>.
    As described above, one application of the Hadamard results in
    <code>&#x221a;(1/2)|0> + &#x221a;(1/2)|1></code>.
    To understand what happens when you apply the Hadamard a second time,
    you need to realize that applying an operator to
    a superposition of states is the combination of applying that operator
    to each of the individual states that make up that superposition.
    So, in this case, you are applying the Hadamard separately to both
    <code>&#x221a;(1/2)|0></code> and <code>&#x221a;(1/2)|1></code>.
</p>
<p>
    Applying the Hadamard to <code>&#x221a;(1/2)|0></code> gives:
</p>
<code>&#x221a;(1/2)&#x221a;(1/2)|0> + &#x221a;(1/2)&#x221a;(1/2)|1></code>
<p>
    which gives you
</p>
<code>0.5 |0> + 0.5 |1></code>
<p>
    Applying the Hadamard to <code>&#x221a;(1/2)|1></code> gives:
</p>
<code>&#x221a;(1/2)&#x221a;(1/2)|0> - &#x221a;(1/2)&#x221a;(1/2)|1>)</code>
<p>
    which of course is
</p>
<code>0.5 |0> - 0.5 |1></code>
<p>
    Combining these gives:
</p>
<code>0.5 |0> + 0.5 |1> + 0.5 |0> - 0.5 |1></code>
<p>
    The two instances of <code>|0></code> combine,
    and the two instances of <code>|1></code> cancel each other out,
    to give a final state of <code>|0></code>.
    This process of states re-enforcing and cancelling each other out is
    known as <em>interference</em>.
    It is the same quantum principle behind the interference pattern
    that results from the famous two-slit experiment with light.
</p>
<p>
    Similarly, applying the Hadamard twice to <code>|1></code> brings the
    state of the system back to <code>|1></code>.
